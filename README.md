# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The school board has asked Maria for assistance even though they are unaware of the full degree of the academic dishonesty. They want to uphold state testing requirements despite this. She has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Maria wants us to repeat the school district analysis we completed in this lesson after we've updated the math and reading scores, and then write up a report outlining how these modifications influenced the analysis as a whole.
